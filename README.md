add funny edits to images and animated GIFs.
- [A Minecraft mod](https://github.com/ShaksterNano/Entranced) that adds enchantments.
- [A few animated greeting cards](https://github.com/ShaksterNano/Animated-Cards) as early programming practices.

I've also contributed to [a Minecraft mod](https://github.com/fox-lol/cats-plus) that adds cat related features.
